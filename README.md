It's a cool custom token Launchpad, if you ever wanted to launch custom cryptocurrency tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana or YOUR_NAME_TOKEN but you first wanted to test it out how without spending a lot of money on those liquidity pools then you can try my app at :
https://solana-adapter.vercel.app

It's on devnet so you don't have to pay real SOL like that on mainnet blockchain.
To try it out first connect your any solana wallet like phantom or backpack or even metamask to devnet instead of mainnet so that you don't have to pay for gas.
Go to my website airdrop yourself some solana to cover the gas fees.
Then just just switch to "Create Token" page of my website to create your first token in just few clicks.
You just have to fill basic details of your token and baam! you created your first token with just 1 simple button.
Mint yourself some supply of tokens then you can just manage them with the interactive UI of my webpage.

My website can automatically detect the all custom tokens your wallet have currently and you can manage them with the simple UI.

Try it out and give some feedback, you are just few clicks away to have an experience.
You can just check out my code and look into solana docs for reference.
I would strongly urge you to give it a try and build it by yourself and don't forget to make it 2x better than me in terms of functionality and UI so that you can own it.

Thanks for trying it out, or if you are just still reading, man what you waiting for! go ahead and tap on the link above.
